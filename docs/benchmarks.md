Without the Composer vendor filter the same project yields 52,948 files and 242 files with parse errors. The difference is package tests, fixtures and a stale copy of Drupal core under `vendor/composer` that no autoloader reaches.

The case set covers custom code reaching core, contrib and vendor classes, functions declared in `.module` and `.inc` files, an aliased namespace import, a class declared in two places, and four positions that must return nothing.
